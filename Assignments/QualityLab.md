# Quality Lab

## Game One: Red Dead Redemption 2
Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) has an exceptional Transcedent perception of quality. The level 
of detail and graphics in the game goes above and beyond even amongst triple A titles. In
each character model, you can see their skin pores and the tiniest strands of facial hair,
and the world accurately emulates the beautiful natural scenery of the Wild West. RDR2
has keen level of detail such as using a catalogue as an interface for shopping and even
the horse's testicles will retract according to the temperature. Overall, Rockstar put
a lot of love and care into the game, something most studios are lacking nowaday, and
every player can see it.

RDR2 also contains all of its necessary features. The main feature being its extraordinary
single-player campaign of the fall of the Van Der Linde gang and the slow death of the 
legendary Wild West. The well written story draws your attention and makes you feel for
the characters, and hundreds of side quests, encounters, and secrets are littered across
the enormous map and attract your attention as much as the campaign does. Although it wasn't
available at launch, RDR2 also features a multiplayer mode where you and your friends can
enact your Wild West fantasies, and like its single-player counterpart, the multiplayer
also contains a campaign and many side activities.

Overall, RDR2 could be considered one of the greatest games of the decade. The attention to 
details and exemplary game modes goes beyond what players expect for even triple A games.

## Game Two: Left 4 Dead 2


## Game Three: Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
Compared to other games coming out during its release, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (ACB)
had average graphics meaning it wasn't the most groundbreaking and detailed nor was it bad 
and low quality. However, the game still looked amazing and had over a hundred npcs 
interacting in the world, which was very impressive for its time, and the game hardly had
any glitches with the npc's AI preventing any weird yet humorous sightings. All of these
properties contributes to its Transcedent perception of quality.

The game also has its desired features. For one, as an Assassin's Creed (AC) game, ACB 
includes many features from its predecessors like the hidden blade and blending/hiding with 
the environment, and the game even improved a few of the mechanics from previous games. An 
example is the addition of chain-killing to its combat system and the introduction of
the crossbow to help ranged takedowns. ACB's greatest feature was the Brotherhood system,
a mechanic where you trained and improved npcs that helped you throughout the game in many
ways like providing a distraction, backing you up in a fight, or even assassinating your
target for you.

Not only looked good, functioned well, and had great features, ACB is considered a 
great game and even one of the best AC games even to this day. Its unique features 
spiced up its gameplay and made it very fun and refreshing to all AC players.
