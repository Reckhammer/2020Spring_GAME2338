##Game One: Red Dead Redemption 2


##Game Two: Left 4 Dead 2


##Game Three: Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
  Compared to other games coming out during its release, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood (ACB)
had average graphics meaning it wasn't the most groundbreaking and detailed nor was it bad 
and low quality. However, the game still looked amazing and had over a hundred npcs 
interacting in the world, which was very impressive for its time, and the game hardly had
any glitches with the npc's AI preventing any weird yet humorous sightings. All of these
properties contributes to its Transcedent perception of quality.
  The game also has its desired features. For one, as an Assassin's Creed (AC) game, ACB 
includes many features from its predecessors like the hidden blade and blending/hiding with 
the environment, and the game even improved a few of the mechanics from previous games. An 
example is the addition of chain-killing to its combat system and the introduction of
the crossbow to help ranged takedowns. ACB's greatest feature was the Brotherhood system,
a mechanic where you trained and improved npcs that helped you throughout the game in many
ways like providing a distraction, backing you up in a fight, or even assassinating your
target for you.
  Not only looked good, functioned well, and had great features, ACB is considered a 
great game and even one of the best AC games even to this day. Its unique features 
spiced up its gameplay and made it very fun and refreshing to all AC players.
