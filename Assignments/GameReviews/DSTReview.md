## Summary
I have played this game for 150+ hours, and very far into the end game section

Your character, with a name that starts with a 'w', is trapped in a very, very
unforgiving world ruled by the newest usurper to the Shadow Throne, Charlie,
and in this top down survival game, you have to forage and craft resources to
protect yourself from the darkness that leads to instant death and ensure that 
you don't starve (That becomes the least of your worries). However this time, 
you do not have to do survive alone in this standalone expansion of the 
singleplayer Don't Starve game, and your friends and you fight the elements 
together to Don't Starve Together.

Because of its namesake, starving is a big part of the game. Managing your food
is very important not only because you die, but some characters and food gives
bonus stats that will help your survive, and some characters have very strict diets.
Most food related structures are top priority when starting out and can decide
whether or not you survive the first winter. The most crucial structure is the
crockpot which allows you to combine ingredients to make exponentially better food
than just cooking up a rabbit. However, hunger is not the only thing you have to
manage. Sanity is one of the most difficult attributes to manage for new players,
for once you hit a certain threshold, shadow creatures will start to lurk around you,
rabbits turn into horrific and useless beardlings, and flowers become evil and lower
your insanity even further once eaten. At a even lower threshold, the shadow creatures
become real to you and attack.

Another mechanic in the game is the environment. The most obvious factor is the 
season. Each season have their own attributes such as plants cannot grow during winter,
so you have to build structures such as drying racks and refridgerators to preserve 
your food. This is one example of countering the season, but the most concerning is 
their weather. During winter and summer, you have to build the proper clothing and 
equipment to protect yourself from the deadly temperatures. But seasons become even
deadlier when their boss spawns. The Winter's Deerclops shows no mercy on a new
player's base, and Bearger leaves no crumbs for the player during Autumn. If the player
manages to kill one of these bosses, they gain a rare crafting material to create
very powerful gear and tons of meat to devour too. The game also sends waves of 
ferocious hounds to attack you every few days, so many new players try to set up base 
new a village of Pigmen to defend them. However, this becomes a dire mistake every 
full moon, which is the only time the player is free to travel at night without a 
light source, as the Pigmen turn into WerePigs that kill anything in their territory. 
Once the player becomes confident or curious, they might journey into the underground 
cavern system, a literal darker version of the overworld, but the dangers exponentially 
increase. Fortunately the rewards also increase exponentially increase as well.

Like other survival games, DST features a crafting system, which is actually unique. 
At the start of a world, you can craft a few essentials such as an axe and pickaxe, 
but once you craft a Science Machine, you can craft most items as long as you are near 
the structure. This structure allows you to craft better equipment and other crafting 
stations to craft even better gear, and once you crafted an item, you can always craft 
that item even if you're not near the station as long as you have the materials. 
Eventually you want to craft magical gear such as the Shadow Sword and Elemental staffs,
the best equipment in the game, using rare materials like gems.

To give you an edge and a different playstyle, DST offers a large roster of characters
to play that is still being added to this day, and each character has their own strengths,
weaknesses, and attributes that make them unique. One of my favorite character is WX-78
the Souless Automaton. He starts off with below average stats, but he can eat gears which
heals and fills him dramatically and increase his max stats until he has 400Hp, 400 Hunger,
and 350 Sanity, the most out of any character. WX-78 can also be struck by lightning which
will heal him, give him a 50% speed boost, and make him into a light source at the cost of
some of his sanity. However, he cannot be wet or he'll start to spark and take damage. The
other characters are even more unique and have different playstyles that gives a whole new
fun experience.

## Final Thoughts
I think this game can be very fun but very unforgiving and brutal to the player. Sometimes
you feel on top of the world once you kill a boss or get a rare resource, but most times
it feels like the game trips you, kicks you down even further, and picks you back up only
to kick you back down again. The game is very difficult especially to new players since
the tutorial is next to nonexistent and slightest slip up could lead to wiping the whole
world, but this difficulty and learning curve makes the game fun. Eventually you become a
pro and able to defeat the common bosses without breaking a sweat and survive for hundreds 
of days and seasons, but in the end game, a lot of the bosses become a lot work for a 
useless reward. One boss has 75K health just to drop an item to make a mushroom lamp. Also, 
there is clear divide between the characters. Some characters are completely useless or 
have skills that are weaker versions of the stronger characters, so they get overshadowed.
Despite its flaws, I heartedly recommend this game, for it's challenging experience greatly
reward those who learn the secrets of this dark world at least until the end game, which
almost no one makes it to.
