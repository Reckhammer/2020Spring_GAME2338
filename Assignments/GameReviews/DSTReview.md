## Summary

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

I have played this game for 150+ hours, and very far into the end game section

Your character, with a name that starts with a 'w', is trapped in a very, very
unforgiving world ruled by the newest usurper to the Shadow Throne, Charlie,
and in this top down survival game, you have to forage and craft resources to
protect yourself horrific monsters that lurk in the shadows and ensure that you 
don't starve (That becomes the least of your worries). However this time, you
do not have to do survive alone in this standalone expansion of the singleplayer
Don't Starve game, and your friends and you fight the elements together to Don't
Starve Together.

Because of its namesake, starving is a big part of the game. Managing your food
is very important not only because you die, but some characters and food gives
bonus stats that will help your survive, and some characters have very strict diets.
Most food related structures are top priority when starting out and can decide
whether or not you survive the first winter. The most crucial structure is the
crockpot which allows you to combine ingredients to make exponentially better food
than just cooking up a rabbit. However, hunger is not the only thing you have to
manage. Sanity is one of the most difficult attributes to manage for new players,
for once you hit a certain threshold, shadow creatures will start to lurk around you,
rabbits turn into horrific and useless beardlings, and flowers become evil and lower
your insanity even further once eaten.

## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.
