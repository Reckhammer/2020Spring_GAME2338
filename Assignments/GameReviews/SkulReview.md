## Summary
In this action packed, side scrolling RogueLite, you play as Skul, a small
skeleton, and as one of the last few survivors of the human invasion, Skul has
to fight through the Imperial Army, heroes, and monsters to save his comrades
and the Demon King. During his journey, Skul has to increase his power, skills,
and knowledge to get a-Head of the enemy.

As one of key features, Skul is able to equip the skulls of other creatures and
gain their power. Everyone stops mocking the tiny skeleton after he transforms
into a giant minotaur that sends his enemies flying or a savage werewolf that
tears enemies to pieces with lightning fast agility. There are dozens of 
different skulls to equip each with unique stats and abilities that can vary
between times of aquisition. For example, the gargoyle skull either has a 
stomp ability or temporary invulnerability. Each skull has their own fighting
styles, and it is recommended for players to find the one that best suits
their playstyle to assure victory.

Like most RogueLites, this game features an item system that enhance the 
player's stats and other bonuses. Some give flat boosts such as increased 
attack power, and others can give unique passives such as lightning bolts will
stick, usually killing, a random enemy in the level. There are also powerful
unique items called quintessances that give strong bonuses upon use. An example
is incoming damage reduced by 50% or defeated enemies drop more gold for a 
limited time after activation. Most of the items can be acquired through a 
selection of stores that occurs every few rooms, and these stores take gold 
from defeated enemies and hidden treasure piles as payment.  Also, like other 
RogueLites, all items are lost once the player has been defeated. However,
the only item that is kept between attempts to save the Demon King is a
currency called dark quartz, and this currency is used to increase Skul's
power with permanent stat boosts like increased maximum health and decreased
cooldowns on abilities.

The foes that Skul faces in defense of his kingdom are numerous. Most are 
knights of the Imperial Army or fellow monsters turned traitor through
dark magic. Sometimes, human adventurers, with egos bigger than the screen,
block your path, and they fight with powerful abilities and are much stronger
than the average foe. At the end of each chapter, Skul must fight an
enormous Boss that will require all of the skill and power that he can muster.

## Final Thoughts
I thought this game was very fun and very unique compared to most RogueLites.
The skulls actually fulfill their promise on having a playstyle that everyone
can enjoy, and I can the vast replayabilty, the most important feature to all
RogueLites, through the variety of skulls. I got very confused when the same
skull had different abilities since the game had no mention of this, but I
did appreciate the menu that tells all of the stats, passives, and the current
abilities of the skull. It even told you what all the items that you have
collected did, a feature I wish was in other RogueLites. Even though I played
only two hours, I could feel myself getting better at the combat and figuring
out which skulls best suited me. The game is very humorous and adorable, and
the game has a lot of quality despite being a early access game. I can see
this game doing very well since it many features that I think are improvements
for the genre.
