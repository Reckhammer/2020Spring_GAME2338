## Summary
During the Great War, the world was plunged into nuclear armageddon, and all 
civilization ceased to exist when the atomic hellfire died out. However, the
United States constructed 200 facilities, called Vaults, in order to preserve 
humanity and restore civilization once the world recovers. 25 years after the 
great war, you are one of the inhabitants of Vault 76 located in what was 
formerly West Virginia. This Vault was specifically tasked to reclaim the wild
and dangerous world left behind by the bombs, and the day has finally come to
leave the Vault. Upon leaving the Vault, you find that the area is infected by
a strange, even by the standards of mutations, disease that will consume and
destroy the world again. As a vault dweller, you can follow in the Overseer's,
the leader of the vault, footsteps to stop this catastrophe or you can become
one of the monsters that destoryed the world in the first place.

To be an inhabitant of a Vault, you have to be the best especially to restore
the world, and you further develop your skills in the wastelands. Unlike the 
other Fallout games, the skill points system was completely thrown out and
replaced by the new perk card system. Every level you can choose a perk card
that gives you new skills, and every five levels you get a whole pack of these
cards. For most cases if you get a duplicate card, you can combine the cards 
and increae the skill or bonus. However, you cannot use all of your cards at 
the same time. Each card takes up a certain amount of points and belong to a
certain SPECIAL stat's category, and you are limited to the amount points you 
have in your SPECIAL stats, these are fundamental stats of your character.
In this new world, you need to be strong to survive.

As a vault dweller, you are also given many tools to survive the wasteland.
The main tool in your arsenal is the CAMP, a tool that allows you to set up
shop almost anywhere. You can build a fortress with turrets and many other
armaments to defend yourself and property from the monsters of the wastes or
a nice, warm homestead to enjoy the company of friends and farming. You can
also takeover some structures from before the war to make resources to survive.
Examples of these are the Munitions Factory, where you make any ammunition in
the game, and the Mama Dolce's Food Factory to make canned food that doesn't rot.
When you take over these resource factories, the whole server knows that the 
factory is being used, and they can attack and steal the resources you are making
or even the factory itself. Even after the world has ended, people continue to
fight each other to take their resources.

The most important feature of this game and the one that all Fallout fans have
been waiting for is multiplayer. Unlike previous installments, you can party up
with your friends to survive the wasteland and complete quests together. They also
added new events that reoccur in cycles that you can participate with your friends,
and these can range from collecting honey for a decrepit tea making robot and
taking on the raving beast behind the infection taking over the world. You can
also trade the goods you have collected with other survivors either in person or
with the new trading machines.

## Final Thoughts
A multiplayer Fallout is what all fans have been waiting for, but when this game
released, everyone was disappointed at the state of the game. Between the stress
tests, Beta, and the final release, almost no changes were made despite being
very needed. Quests, enemies, and almost everything would glitch out and break.
Although, it is fun to go around completing quests with your friends, and everything
seemed like they advertised. But the fun and good times quickly turned into hours
of annoyance and misery as people kept getting disconnected or experiencing a
game breaking glitch. Besides the glitches and connection problems, the game makes
it hard to progress. The developers have made this game into a looter shooter but
have made no attempts to make it into a looter shooter. It is very annoying to fight
a 3 star legendary enemy only to have it to drop a one star item, a very bad item too,
and this even includes the raid battle. Looter shooters always have at least one rule:
tougher enemies give better loot, but in Fallout 76, getting good loot is trying to get
a 20 on a d20 with the 20 scratched off. Despite the horrible launch, the developers 
are working to get it on track. They communicate with the community are releasing
content, although buggy at first each time, and patches. The game is drastically
different from when its release and has incredible potential. The game is very fun
with all of the events and content, but the content does not last long. And the game
has no end game due to the lack of improvement in your equipment from the horrible
drop rates.
