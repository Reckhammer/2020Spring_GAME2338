## Summary
In this 2D RogueLite, become the infamous space pirate, Captain Flinthook, and 
pillage procedurely generated ships with your trusty grappling hook, chronobelt, 
and blasma pistol. You swing room to room for gold, loot, and skills, but the 
treasures are guarded by swarms of enemies, traps, and bosses. As you proceed 
from ship to ship, you do not heal making each ship more treacherous than the
last and each scrap of food much more valuable. 

Your main tool for plundering is your trusty grappling hook, your main method of
movement and evading traps. Each room contains hooks that anchor your hook 
allowing you swing around the room at high speeds. However, swinging around the
room at mach speeds like a crazed maniac is not the only utility. Some enemies
are protected by bubbles blocking all shots from the Blasma pistol, so you have
to pop their bubble with your pointy hook. Unfortunately, the hook does not have
any other direct effect on enemies. Becoming fast and precise with the hook
determines how far you reach in the game and decides who's the better space pirate.

After reaching mach speeds from swinging around the room, Captain Flinthook 
becomes very hard to control, and dodging the walls of bullets is nearly 
impossible at high speeds. The solution to this dilema is the chronobelt, a waist
mounted device that allows you to slow down time. With the help from this device,
weaving into the gaps between bullets and blasting enemies, not only looks a lot
more cool, becomes child's play. However, the chronobelt can only be used for a
small amount of time before it has to recharge, so you have to manage its use
to ensure your safety from traps and bullets.

Before you start your series of raids, you can select your perk loadout giving
you buffs and skills. Most are utility and passive skills like you are more likely
to find food or you do more damage while your health is lower. Other skills 
change the way your equipment works such as making your pistol into a shotgun but
the pellets do less damage or into a long range mortar that lobs your shots.
However, these perks and the expansion of your perk loadout has to be bought between
runs in the black market shop with a currency you earn for completing raids. Once
you buy the perks in the black market, they are yours to use in the your raids for
as long as you play. While raiding ships, you can use gold to buy more skills and
items, but once you die or complete the run of ship raids, the perks are gone.

During your raids, you can chose your next target ship, but each ship has a list 
of modifiers that can let you know what to expect on the ship. The Cornucorpia
modifiers means that food is more likely to spawn making it a lifesaver if you
are running low on health. The Battalion modifiers means that every room is
a battle room, so in you have to fight waves of enemies in each room. Some modifiers
tell you if a certain room is on board, and others can tell the ship's difficulty.
Selecting the right ship to get the loot you want or avoiding hazards you hate can
ensure the completion of your run.

## Final Thoughts
At first, I thought the game was difficult and frustrating, but once I started
learning how to use the hook and the chronobelt, the game became phenominally
easier. The game just clicked in my head, and I was able to fly through ships in a 
matter of seconds without a single scratch most of the time. For being a RogueLite
game, a genre where replayabilty is the core aspect, Flinthook got very repetitive
very fast. You quickly learn each room and how to dodge each trap, so the game becomes 
very stale. I found the combat to be very annoying. Your bullets have a very small 
range and cannot go through walls, but the enemies' bullets have an infinite range, 
go through walls, and come out in very large groupings. There are many times where 
the bullets completely block every possible path, and slowing down time cannot even 
save you from taking damage. Overall, I thought the game was very fun at first, when
I was learning the game and its mechanics, but prolonged play become boring and 
repetitive when most threats became avoidable and had the same feeling.
