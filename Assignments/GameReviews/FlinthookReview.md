## Summary

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Become the infamous space pirate, Captain Flinthook, and pillage procedurely
generated ships with your trusty grappling hook, chronobelt, and blasma pistol.
You plunder ships for gold, loot, and skills, but the ships are guarded by swarms
of enemies and bosses.


## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.
