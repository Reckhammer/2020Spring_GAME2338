## Summary
I played this game for about 2 hours and completed about a third of the game.

Go Home Dinosaurs is about a group of gophers trying to have a nice barbeque, but
they are invaded by dinosaurs. To defend your lunch, you build turrets around a
lane that the dinosaurs travel on, and you have to make sure the dinosaurs do not
make it to your steaks at the end of the lane. Tiles surround the lane that you
travel on and set up your defenses.

In order to defend your barbeque from the dinosaurs, you are given many different
types of defences such as lasers, freeze rays, bad DJ gophers, and more. Unlike
other tower defense games, each defense has a specified pattern, similar to a 
tetris piece, of how it can be placed on the tile board, so you have to be very 
precise on how you place your defenses. Also, they have very specific ways they
attack, so they have very niche situation to use them. For example, the laser
can hit multiple enemies in only a straight line, so it's best to use it on
level with very straight lanes. The DJ gophers attack in three directions 
simultaneously, so they are most efficient on corners. Some of the defenses have
more utility such as the teleporter, which sends the dinosaurs back to the start 
of the lane. However it is very slow to start up between teleports. You also can 
have stim abilities that you can use (I personally never used them so I don't 
know how effective they are), such as increased damage for your character and 
dynamite to insta-clear a portion of the lane.

To pay for the defenses, you have to collect coconuts around the level.
However, you also have to defend the lanes with your character until you have 
your defenses up, so you have to balance collecting the currency and fighting
the dinosaurs yourself. Another unique mechanic is the deck system for your
defenses. Before the level starts, you have to fill your deck with the defenses 
or stims that you want to take into the level limited by the maximum number,
which increases as you be levels.

Like your defenses, the dinosaurs come in many different variants as well. The
basic dinosaur is the triceratop which has the standard health and speed. There
is the stegosaurus is large with the slowest speed and most health, and there 
are swarms of small dinosaurs with very small amount of health. During the levels
at certain intervals, a Dino Swarm will occur where certain dinosaurs will come
flying out the starting point and skip to a portion of the lane and, sometimes,
skip over some of your defenses. Every twenty levels, you will face a boss dinosaur,
which is usually an upgraded version of one of the normal dinosaur, but while you
are dealing with the boss, swarms of dinosaurs will continue to attempt to steal
your steak.

## Final Thoughts
As soon as you look at it, you can tell that this game is meant for children,
and the game starts out pretty easy. However, at a certain point, it suddenly
increases the difficulty especially to perfect the level, but it seems that
some defenses are made for certain levels. Without those defenses, the levels
are almost impossible to beat. I found that it is weird for a tower defense
game, where you fight hordes of enemies, to have over half of the defenses to
be single target. Also the dinosaurs seemed to be the same despite the vast 
visual differences. They all just walk to end of the lane and nothing more.
Overall, I found the game fun and unique with the defense placement, but other
parts of the game to be a bit lack luster.
