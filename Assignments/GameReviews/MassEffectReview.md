## Summary
I have played over a 1000 hours of this game, and once a year, I replay the game again.

For combat, the core mechanics is the large variety of abilities between your character and your npc squadmates. Most of the abilities just do flat damage, some do more to certain types of health bars such as shield, but there are many utility abilities. One example is pulling enemies out of cover using a ball of gravity or freezing them in place. Some abilities are niche abilities such as the AI hacking ability, which makes a robot enemy fight against its own allies. Only the Engineer class can get the ability naturally, and it can only be used on robotic enemies. Although this seems normal for a RPG game to have, it really gets interesting when you can command your squadmates when to use, who to use it on, and what ability to use. With the help of your squadmates, the weaknesses of your classes can be covered by your teammates and you can have complete control of it by either using the ability to tell your teammates or even go into the options to set certain conditions of when and what to cast them.

Another feature was exploring planets. In your rover tank, the M-35 Mako, you can climb steep mountains, collect minerals, and even complete sidequests on them, and there are many planets to explore. Although many sidequests lead you to these planets, many of them don't have anything to direct you to them besides finding them on your galactic map on your ship. With the large number of planets, each have their own hazards such as High and sub-zero temperatures, weather, and even gigantic worm monsters that spit acid.

Finally, one of the greatest features of Mass Effect is the interactive dialogue and story. Many RPG games have dialogue choices, but very of them seem to have an impact on anything. There are many times where the fate of your teammates relied on your choices, and some can only be made if the dialogue skills have been leveled up. If one of your dialogue skills was high enough, you could convince the final boss to commit suicide and skip a phase in the boss fight. Mass Effect is one of the first games where you could have a real relationship with the npcs, for some, it could even be a romantic one too. This game does a really good job of bringing out the characters where you actually begin to feel for them and feel like you are in their world.

## Final Thoughts
For this game, I really liked their combat system, but a few abilities seemed to mimic other abilities and do almost the exact thing. A few abilities were too unique and had to require very niche situations such as where only one class could get that ability, use it on a very specific type of enemy, and sometimes are not even worth the skill points. This leads into the complete ability overhaul in the sequel games. For exploring, it is very interesting to explore and navigate planets, but a lot of them are very empty. Or, the planet had very rough terrain for the tank to traverse. For example, the tank had a very hard time climbing up mountains and most of the planets are very mountainous that are very steep. A nitpick that I have is that sometimes the dust particles coming off of the tank's tires sometimes didn't match with the ground. Red dirt shouldn't be brown when flying off a tire! Despite these flaws, I still consider this one of the best games. The storytelling and the universe is very alluring and interesting, and Bioware just has the talent for making you build a comraderie with these virtual people to the point where some people become obsessed with them. I think every RPG player has to try out the Mass Effect series.
