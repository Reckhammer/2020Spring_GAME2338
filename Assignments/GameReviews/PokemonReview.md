## Summary
Once again, you start your Pokemon journey to become the champion of the region.
As an only child of a single mother, you become the rival of the current champion's
little brother, Hop, after receiving your starter pokemon from the champion, and
you quickly set out to travel across the region to strengthen your pokemon to
defeat everyone in your path. Meanwhile, you are also trying to solve the mystery
of the region's legendary pokemon and fight off a gang, although this one is a
lot less criminal than last few. More importantly, you are creating a bond with
your pokemon to become stronger, so you can be a pokemon master.

To prove your strength, you can battle other pokemon trainers. Although most 
trainers are there to impede your progress, a few trainers, such as gym leaders,
are an actual challenge to defeat. You can also fight wild pokemon that you can
defeat or capture to make an addition to your team. After all battles, your
pokemon gain experience points that can increase their level and power, and as
they level up, they can stronger moves or even evolve to gain even more power.
In this latest generation, your pokemon can use Dynamaxing to further increase
their power for a duration of the battle. You can only use this power in only gym
battles or raid battles, which are battles with a wild dynamaxed pokemon. This
ability makes your pokemon into a giant and can even change their form, and all
the pokemon's moves are drastically increased and can affect the entire battlefield.
However, this ability can only be used for only three turns before your pokemon
has to return to their normal form.

As a pokemon trainer, battling is not your only purpose. Creating a bond with
your pokemon is crucial to your success. Battling does increase your friendliness
with your pokemon, but there are less violent ways to increase your friendship that
a lot more effective. You can camp with your pokemon, and while you are camping,
you can play with your pokemon with toys like a ball and a cat toy. You can also make
curry for your pokemon with a cooking minigame which will not only increase their 
exp and friendship but also heal them. With these new features, you feel closer to
your pokemon and even closer to being a real trainer as depicted as in the shows.

## Final Thoughts
This game is about as fun as the previous games that I played as a child. Going around
battling pokemon and trainers feels about the same, but this is also the downfall of
the game. Over the years, the pokemon games more or less feel the same. They just have
different accessory features, and this game seems to a lot easier than other Pokemon 
game. At the beginning of the game, you receive a whopping 30 pokeballs instead of the
previous 5 balls to fill up your team. You do not need a pokemon on your team to know
all of the HM moves to navigate the game, so you have room for another actual pokemon 
to train. The most irritating for old school pokemon players is that your rival heals
your pokemon before you battle! In the previous games, you trudged through a cave
swarming with Zubats, trainers with too much potions, and the region's criminal gang,
and when you exit the cave with your pokemon barely standing, your rival swoops in
to finish your miserable life with a stockpile of hyperpotions and full restores. I
also personally hate the camping system in this game. I would rather just battle other
pokemon. However this game does have an interesting pokedex that is both visually and
strategically appealing with interesting looks and type combinations. This game also
makes gyms innovative and more interesting than the previous game's simple battle a
bunch of trainers. Overall, this game is fun to both newcomers and diehard pokemon 
fans. The new features and pokemon brings another interesting flair despite the "if
ain't broke don't fix it" feel of the games.
