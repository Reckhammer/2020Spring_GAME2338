**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules of the game was understandable and easy to learn, but some of the more advanced features were not explained why. For example, the map layout was confusing, and you are told no information about it except how to pull it out.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I did not notice anything removable besides the cosmetics shop, since all you can only purchase aesthetic items like outfits and other customizable items for your character.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is imbalanced to solo players. There are multiple classes for this game, and missing any of them can provide a huge hinderance to the game flow. They do have some sort of helper/supplement to help out the solo player, but it does not beat having a human teammate.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing for the game was slow. The loading screens require very minimal time, but while playing, there was a lot of down time between fighting swarms of enemies and collecting resources. This could be due to me playing solo and on lower difficulties, but no matter what, there was a lot time of me just walking around

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics and theme went hand in hand together perfectly, and this game really gives you the feeling of being a space miner.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had some fun playing the game by myself, but I am almost sure that the game will be a lot more fun with human teammates or friends, since you are not stumbling around from not being able to use certain tools and mechanics.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The tutorial was not as linear as you would think a tutorial would be. For example, they are trying to teach you how to find a tunnel based on certain markers, but I still somehowed mined past the tunnel and spent a long time trying to find it. The most annoying problem is, when you mine with a pickaxe, you make a square hole in the wall that is smaller than you, so when you are trying to make a tunnel, which is a huge aspect of the game, you keep getting stuck since you are taller than the tunnel.
